          In Week 2 of the WebVR content, we drew some 3D images out of what are called <b><i>Primitives Entities</i></b>. In the image below, I drew a pig.<br><img width = "60%" src="https://aframewebvrweek2--sn33r.repl.co/assets/images/PiggyVisualInspector.png"><br>
          Each piece of the pig was placed in 3D space based on its <b><i>global position</b></i>, its position based in the larger scene.<br>
          However, if we ever wanted to move the pig in the scene, it would have been a pain to make sure all the pieces were moved properly.<br>
          It would have been better if all the parts of the pig knew that they belonged to the pig and knew about where they should be in terms the pig itself.  Then we could just change the location of the pig. <br>
          We can make everything a child of the parent pig.  And then we can set the location of everything to be proper locally around the pig. The term for this is the the <b><i>local position</b></i>.<br>

        <h3> Video Lesson</h3>
        <p>Watch the video and follow along programming into a repl.  Submit your code.  Remember you need the line:
          <b><code>   &ltscript src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js"&gt &lt/script&gt </code></b></p>

          Complete the pizza by adding at least 7 slices of pepperoni!  After you are done, verify you did it correctly by changing the position of the pizza entity.  Also try changing the scale of the pizza and make it a smaller or larger size
