        <h3>Looking Ahead at This Week</h3>
        <p class = "content">
          This week we are trying to cover several of the more abstract concepts of AFrame. This will allow us to much more complicated projects. We are going to discuss two types of Hierarchies so maybe we should start with a definition of the word Hierarchy. 
          <h4>Hierarchy : an arrangement of items (objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one another.</h4>
          Below or above does not mean better for our cases;it is about grouping.  Examples might be Principal, Teacher, Student or Country, Province, County, Town.

          <h3>Lessons:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Understanding the Hierarchy of Parent and Child Entities</li>

            </div>
          </ol>
          This week is part of a training montage and we need to get these concepts under our belts if we are going to do more complicated projects.
